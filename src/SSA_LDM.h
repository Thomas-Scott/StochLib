	\brief Gillespie's Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA): logarithmic direct method.
	
	This algorithm is generally faster than the direct method only when the number of reactions is
	around 3000-4000 or more. However, it is usually slower than the constant time algorithm
	and is therefore not recommended for most problems.
